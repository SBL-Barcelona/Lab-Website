Exciting news! âš¡âš¡

This Spring Clara will be participating in the **Behavioral Insights Academy** at the **United Nations Office for Counter-Terrorism**.

As part of the UN International Hub on [**Behavioral Insights to Counter Terrorism**](https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/behavioural-insights), Clara will provide training and mentoring to practitioners, UN program managers, civil society organizations, and member state government officials in charge of Counter Terrorism programs. 

The goal of the BI Academy is to help practitioners apply and evaluate behavioral insights into their programs. A behavioural insights approach enables the identification of risk and resilience factors and the development of empirically validated interventions for policymakers and practitioners to effectively prevent and counter violent extremism.

The Behavioral Insights Hub is aÂ global platform for creating knowledge around behavioural insights to prevent and counter terrorism, disseminating lessons learned and good practices, and creating a professional network of experts, academics, practitioners, and policymakers.

Very excited to take part in this!
