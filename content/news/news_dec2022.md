### 📌 December, 2022

Big announcement! 🎉🎉

**We have been awarded the** **internationally competitive [BIAL Foundation grant](https://fundacaobial.com/com/grants/)** to research cognitive flexibility effects on vulnerability to misinformation!

This is a project we conceived together with the [**Center for Brain at Cognition**](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc) at the UPF. The aim is to evaluate whether cognitive flexibility correlates (estimated using EEG) predict vulnerability to partisan misinformation in participants with right-leaning and left-leaning political attitudes.

We are also very interested in distinguishing political orientation from political extremity effects in vulnerability to misinformation. This is because political extremity is usually associated with cognitive rigidity and could be impacting how people respond to misinformation more so than political orientation.

We are excited to start this project and to provide responses to all of these questions!

👉🏼 **We will be announcing a research assistant position** **opening** for this project soon. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClaraPretus) or [Mastodon](https://c.im/@ClaraPretus) if you don’t want to miss it!
