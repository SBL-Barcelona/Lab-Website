We are part of VALAWAI, an EIC funded project that focuses on the development of value-aware artificial intelligence (AI). The project will demonstrate the utility of Value-Aware AI in three application areas for which a moral dimension urgently needs to be included: (i) social media, (ii) social robots, and (iii) medical decision-making.

As part of VALAWAI, we will be leading behavioral and neuroimaging experiments on humans’ response to value-aware AI.
