In this project we will research whether cognitive flexibility correlates (estimated using EEG) predict vulnerability to partisan misinformation in participants with right-leaning and left-leaning political attitudes. 

This is a project we conceived together with the [Center for Brain at Cognition](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc) at the UPF and has been funded by the [BIAL Foundation](https://fundacaobial.com/com/grants/).
