We are part of ARENAS, an ERC funded project that aims to understand and mitigate extreme narratives that challenge European democracies. ARENAS aims to map the spread of extremist narratives in the EU, define remediation strategies for individuals and groups affected by extremist narratives, and provide educational and institutional tools, and policy recommendations to help counter extremist narratives.

As part of ARENAS, we will be leading studies on how extremist social media networks contribute to affective polarization in Spain and France.
