    <p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">Our team uses a cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology approach
       to understand how political extremism impacts decision-making in contexts of political polarization. 
       Particularly, we examine how extreme social identities and moral values shape peopleâ€™s political 
       beliefs, motivation to share misinformation, and willingness to engage in political violence. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">We also develop novel interventions to combat polarization and 
      the spread of misinformation based on insights from psychological and neuracognitive findings.
      We use a multi-method approach that includes neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance 
      (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), psychological testing, and behavioral experiments. </p>

    <p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">Join us in our mission to understand the neuroscience 
      of political extremism and the spread of misinformation. </p>
